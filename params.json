This client works with Hazelcast 3.6 and higher.  \r\n\r\n**Hazelcast** is a clustering and highly scalable data distribution platform. With its various distributed data structures, distributed caching capabilities, elastic nature and more importantly with so many happy users, Hazelcast is a feature-rich, enterprise-ready and developer-friendly in-memory data grid solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nHazelcast Node.js client supports the following data structures and features:\r\n\r\n* Map (including entry processors and `PartitionAware` keys) and MultiMap\r\n* Queue, Set, and List\r\n* Lock\r\n* Smart Client\r\n* Hazelcast Native Serialization\r\n* Distributed Object Listener\r\n* Lifecycle Service\r\n\r\n# Installing the Client\r\n\r\nFollowing command installs Hazelcast Node.js client:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install hazelcast-client --save\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Using the Client\r\n\r\nFollowing script illustrates a basic example in which a map is created in Hazelcast Node.js client and an entry is added to that map:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar HazelcastClient = require('hazelcast-client').Client;\r\nvar person = {\r\n    firstName: \"Joe\",\r\n    lastName: \"Doe\",\r\n    age: 42\r\n};\r\nvar map;\r\nHazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient().then(function (hazelcastClient) {\r\n    map = hazelcastClient.getMap(\"personMap\");\r\n    map.put(1, person).then(function (val) {\r\n        // prints previous value for key `1`\r\n        console.log(val);\r\n    });\r\n    map.get(1).then(function (value) {\r\n        console.log(value);\r\n    })\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see Hazelcast Node.js [code samples](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client/tree/master/code_samples) for more examples.\r\n\r\nYou can also refer to Hazelcast Node.js [API Documentation](http://hazelcast.github.io/hazelcast-nodejs-client/api/0.4/docs/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Development\r\n\r\n## Building And Installing from Sources\r\n\r\nFollow the below steps to build and install Hazelcast Node.js client from its source:\r\n\r\n- Clone the GitHub repository [https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client.git](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client.git).\r\n- Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`.\r\n- Compile TypeScript using the command `npm run compile`.\r\n- Link the package locally using the command `npm link`.\r\n\r\n## Using Locally Installed Package\r\n\r\n- Change directory to the project directory.\r\n- Use a locally linked module: `npm link hazelcast-client`.\r\n- Tryout the example shown in [Using the Client](#using-the-client) section.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Testing Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [Java 6+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/server-jre8-downloads-2133154.html)\r\n* Maven\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Maven automatically downloads hazelcast-remote-controller and hazelcast from maven repository.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Running the Tests\r\n\r\nFollowing command starts the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Release Notes\r\n\r\nYou can see the release notes for each release on the [Releases](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client/releases) page.\r\n\r\n# Mail Group\r\n\r\nPlease join the mail group if you are interested in using or developing Hazelcast.\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/hazelcast\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nHazelcast is available under the Apache 2 License.
